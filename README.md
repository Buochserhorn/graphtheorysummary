# Graph Theory summary
LaTeX-ed collection of all Theorems, Definition, etc. from the lecture notes to the course "Graph Theory" taught by Benny Sudakov and the corresponding exercises from FS 2018 at ETH Zurich

I left out mainly examples and proofs. Numbering is the same as in the lecture notes, gaps in the numbering were made with \addtocounter{thm}{1}.

To be done:
- Check for all exercises, whether result is displayed and not just a question.
- Add a chapter with a collection of proof strategies.
- If somebody has a good way of adding plots I'm open to that.
