\section{Basic notions}
\addtocounter{subsection}{1} 
%\subsection{Graphs}
%\begin{defi}
%A $G$ is a pair $G = (V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of vxs and $E$ is a (multi)set of unordered pairs of vxs. The elements of $E$ are called edges. We write $V (G)$ for the set of vxs and $E(G)$ for the set of edges of a $G$. Also, $|G| = |V (G)|$ denotes the \#
%vxs and $e(G) = |E(G)|$ denotes the \# edges.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}
%\begin{defi}
%A loop is an edge $(v, v)$ for some $v\in V$ . An edge $e = (u, v)$ is a multiple edge if it appears multiple times in $E$. A gr. is simple if it has no loops or multiple edges.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}
%\begin{defi}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Vertices $u, v$ are adjacent in $G$ if $(u, v)\in E(G)$.
%\item An edge $e \in E(G)$ is incident to a vx $v \in V (G)$ if $v \in e$.
%\item Edges $e, e'$ are incident if $e\cap e'\ne \emptyset$.
%\item If $(u, v) \in E $ then $v$ is a neighbour of $u$.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}

\subsection{Graph isomorphism}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
%\begin{defi}
% Let $G_1 = (V_1,E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2,E_2)$ be graphs. An isomorphism $\phi: G_1 \to G_2$ is a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) from $V_1$ to $V_2$ such that $(u, v) \in E_1$ iff $(\phi(u), \phi(v))\in E_2$. We say $G_1$ is isomorphic to $G_2$ if there is an isomorphism between them.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}
\begin{rem}
Isomorphism is an equivalence relation of graphs. (reflexive, symmetric, transitive)
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Any gr. is isomorphic to itself
%\item If $G_1$ is isomorphic to $G_2$ then $G_2$ is isomorphic to $G_1$
%\item If $G_1 $ is isomorphic to $G_2$ and $G_2$ is isomorphic to $G_3$, then $G_1$ is isomorphic to $G_3$.
%\end{itemize}
\end{rem}

\addtocounter{thm}{1}
%\begin{defi}
%An unlabelled gr. is an isomorphism class of graphs.
%\end{defi} 

\subsection{The adjacency and incidence matrices}

%Let $[n] = \{1, \dots , n\}.$

%\begin{defi}
%Let $G = (V,E)$ be a gr. with $V = [n].$ The adjacency matrix $A = A(G)$ is the gr. with $ V = [n]$. The adjacency matrix $A = A(G)$ is the
%$n \times n $ symmetric matrix defined by
%\[a_{ij}=\begin{cases}1 & if (i,j)\in E\\ 0 & otherwise\end{cases}\]
%\end{defi} 
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
%\begin{rem}
%Any adjacency matrix $A $ is real and symmetric, hence the spectral theorem proves that $A$ has an orthogonal basis of eigenvalues with real eigenvectors. This important fact allows us to use spectral methods in gr. theory. Indeed, there is a large subfield of gr. theory called spectral gr. theory.
%\end{rem}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}

%\begin{defi}
%Let $G = (V,E)$ be a gr. with $V = \{v_1, \dots , v_n\}$ and $E = \{e_1, \dots , e_m\}$. Then the incidence matrix $B = B(G)$ of $G$ is the $n\times m$ matrix defined by \[b_{ij}=\begin{cases}1 & if v_i\in e_j\\ 0 & otherwise\end{cases}\]
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{3}
%\begin{rem}
%Every column of $B$ has $|e| = 2$ entries 1.
%\end{rem}

\subsection{Degree}

%\begin{defi}
%Given $G = (V,E)$ and a vx $v \in V$ , we define the neighbourhood $N(v)$ of $v$ to
%be the set of neighbours of $v$. Let the degree $d(v)$ of $v$ be $|N(v)|$, the \# neighbours of $v$. A vx $v$ is isolated if $d(v) = 0.$
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}
%\begin{rem}
%$d(v)$ is the \# 1s in the row corresponding to v in the adjacency matrix $A(G)$ or the incidence matrix $B(G)$.
%\end{rem}
\addtocounter{thm}{1} 
\addtocounter{thm}{1}
\begin{fact}
For any $G$ on the vx set $[n]$ with adjacency and incidence matrices $A$ and $B$, we have $BB^T = D + A$, where
$D=
\begin{pmatrix}
d(1) & 0 & 0  \\
0 & \ddots & 0  \\
0 & 0 & d(n)  
\end{pmatrix}
$  
\end{fact}

%\begin{nota}
%The minimum degree of a $G$ is denoted $\delta(G)$, the maximum degree is denoted $\Delta(G)$. The average degree is \[\overline{d}(G) =\frac{\sum_{v\in G}}{|V(G)|}\] Note that $\delta\le\overline{d}\le\Delta$.
%\end{nota}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}

%\begin{defi}
%A $G$ is $d$-regular iff all vxs have degree $d$.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
\begin{pro}
For every $G = (V,E)$, $\sum_{v\in G}d(G)=2|E|$
\end{pro}

\begin{cor}
Every gr. has an even \# vxs of odd degree.
\end{cor}

\subsection{Subgraphs}

%\begin{defi}
%A gr. $H = (U, F)$ is a subgr. of a gr. $G = (V,E)$ if $U \subseteq V$ and $F \subseteq E$. If $U = V$ then $H$ is called spanning.
%\end{defi}

%\begin{defi}
%Given $G = (V,E)$ and $U\subseteq  V (U \ne \emptyset)$, let $G[U]$ denote the gr. with vx set $U$ and edge set $E(G[U]) = \{e \in E(G) : e \subseteq U\}$. (We include all the edges of $G$ which have both
%endpoints in $U$). Then $G[U]$ is called the subgr. of $G$ induced by $U$.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{3}
\addtocounter{subsection}{1} 
%\subsection{Special graphs}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item  $K_n$ is the complete graph, or a clique. Take $n$ vxs and all possible edges connecting them.
%\item An empty gr. has no edges.
%\item $G = (V,E)$ is bipartite if there is a partition $V = V_1 \cup V_2$ into two disjoint sets such that each $e \in E(G)$ intersects both $V_1$ and $V_2$.
%\item $K_{n,m}$ is the complete bipartite graph. Take $n + m$ vxs partitioned into a set $ A$ of size $n$ and a set $B$ of size $m$, and include every possible edge between $A$ and $B$.
%\end{itemize}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}
\subsection{Walks, paths and cycles}
%
%\begin{defi}
%A walk in $G$ is a sequence of vxs $v_0, v_1, \dots , v_k$, and a sequence of edges $(v_i, v_{i+1}) \in E(G)$. A walk is a path if all $v_i$ are distinct. If for such a path with $k \ge 2$, $(v_0, v_k)$ is also
%an edge in $G$, then $v_0, v_1 \dots , v_k, v_0$ is a cycle. For multigraphs, we also consider loops and pairs of multiple edges to be cycles.
%\end{defi}
%
%\begin{defi}
%The length of a path, cycle or walk is the \# edges in it.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{3}
\begin{pro}
Every walk from u to v in G contains a path between u and v.
\end{pro}

\begin{pro}
Every $G$ with minimum degree $ \delta\ge 2$ contains a path of length $\delta$ and a cycle of length at least $\delta + 1$.
\end{pro}

\begin{rem}
Note that we have also proved that a gr. with minimum degree $\delta\ge 2$ contains cycles of at least $\delta-1$ different lengths. This fact, and the statement of Proposition 1.32, are both tight, to see this, consider the complete gr. $G = K_{\delta+1}$.
\end{rem} 

\subsection{Connectivity}

%\begin{defi}
%A $G$ is conn. if for all pairs $u, v \in G$, there is a path in $G$ from $u$ to $v$.
%\end{defi}
%Note that it suffices for there to be a walk from u to v, by Proposition 1.31.
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
%\begin{defi}
%A (conn.) component of $G$ is a conn. subgr. that is maximal by inclusion. We say $G$ is conn. iff it has one conn. component.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
\begin{pro}
A gr. with $n$ vxs and $m$ edges has at least $n-m$ conn. components.
\end{pro}

\subsection{Graph operations and parameters}

%\begin{defi}
%Given $G = (V,E)$, the complement $\overline{G}$ of $G$ has the same vx set $V$ and $(u, v) \in E(\overline{G})$ iff $(u, v) \notin E(G)$.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
%\begin{defi}
%A clique in $G$ is a complete subgr. in $G$. An independent set is an empty
%induced subgr. in $G$.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
\begin{nota}
Let $\omega(G)$ denote the \# vxs in a maximum-size clique in $G$, let $\alpha(G)$ denote the \# vxs in a maximum-size independent set in $G$.
\end{nota}

\begin{claim}
A vx set $U\subseteq V (G)$ is a clique iff $U\subseteq V(\overline{G})$ is an independent set.
\end{claim}

\begin{cor}
We have $\omega(G)=\alpha(\overline{G})$ and $\alpha(G)=\omega(\overline{G})$.
\end{cor}

\section{Trees}
\subsection{Trees}
%\begin{defi}
%A gr. having no cycle is acyclic. A forest is an acyclic graph, a tree is a conn. acyclic graph. A leaf is a vx of degree 1.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
\begin{lem}
Every finite tree with at least two vxs has at least two leaves. Deleting a leaf from an $n$-vx tree produces a tree with $n-1$ vxs.
\end{lem}

\subsection{Equivalent definitions of trees}

\begin{thm}
For an $n$-vx simple $G$ (with $n \ge 1$), the following are equivalent (and
characterize the trees with $n$ vxs).
(a) $G$ is conn. and has no cycles.
(b) $G$ is conn. and has $n - 1$ edges.
(c) $G$ has $n - 1$ edges and no cycles.
(d) For every pair $u, v \in V (G)$, there is exactly one $u, v$-path in $G$.
\end{thm}

%\begin{defi}
%An edge of a gr. is a cut-edge if its deletion disconnects the graph.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}
\begin{lem}
An edge contained in a cycle is not a cut-edge.
\end{lem}


%\begin{defi}
%Given a conn. $G$, a spanning tree $T$ is a subgr. of $G$ which is a tree and contains every vx of $G$.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}

\begin{cor}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Every conn. gr. on n vxs has at least n - 1 edges and contains a spanning tree,
\item Every edge of a tree is a cut-edge,
\item Adding an edge to a tree creates exactly one cycle.
\end{itemize}
\end{cor}

\subsection{Cayley‚Äôs formula}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}\addtocounter{thm}{1}
\begin{thm}[Cayley‚Äôs Formula]
There are $n^{n-2}$ trees with vx set $[n]$.
\end{thm}

%\begin{defi}[Pr√ºfer code]
%Let $T$ be a tree on an ordered set $S$ of n vxs. To compute the
%Pr√ºfer sequence $f(T)$, iteratively delete the leaf with the smallest label and append the label of its neighbour to the sequence. After $n - 2$ iterations a single edge remains and we have produced a sequence $f(T)$ of length $n - 2$.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
\begin{pro}
For an ordered $n$-element set $S$, the Pr√ºfer code $f$ is a bijection between the trees with vx set $S$ and the sequences in $S^{n-2}$.
\end{pro}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}
%\begin{defi}
%A directed graph, or digr. for short, is a vx set and an edge (multi-)set of ordered pairs of vxs. Equivalently, a digr. is a (possibly not-simple) gr. where each edge is assigned a direction. The out-degree (respectively in-degree) of a vx is the \# edges
%incident to that vx which point away from it (respectively, towards it).
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}

\section{Connectivity}
\subsection{Vertex connectivity}

%\begin{defi}
%A vx cut in a conn. gr. $G = (V,E)$ is a set $ S \subseteq V$ such that $G\setminus S := G[V \setminus S]$ has more than one conn. component. A cut vx is a vx $v$ such that $\{v\}$ is a cut.
%\end{defi}
%\begin{defi}
%$G$ is called $k$-conn. if $|V (G)|> k$ and if $G\setminus X$ is conn. for every set $X \subseteq V$ with $|X|< k$. In other words, no two vxs of $G$ are separated by fewer than $k$ other vxs. Every (non-empty) gr. is 0-conn. and the 1-conn. graphs are precisely the non-trivial conn. graphs. The greatest integer $k$ such that $G$ is k-conn. is the connectivity $\kappa (G)$ of $G$.
%17
%\item $G = K_n: \kappa (G) = n - 1$
%\item $G = K_{m,n}, m \le n: \kappa (G) = m$. Indeed, let $G$ have bipartition $A \cup B$, with $|A|= m$  and $|B|= n$. Deleting $A$ disconnects the graph. On the other hand, deleting $S \subset V$ with $|S|< m$ leaves both $A\setminus S$ and $B\setminus S$ non-empty and any $a \in A\setminus S$ is conn. to any $b \in B \setminus S$. Hence $G\setminus S$ is conn.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
\begin{pro}
For every $G$, $\kappa (G) \le \delta(G)$.
\end{pro} 

\begin{rem}
High minimum degree does not imply connectivity. Consider two disjoint copies of $K_n$.
\end{rem}
\begin{thm}[Mader 1972]
Every gr. of average degree at least $4k$ has a $k$-conn. subgraph.
\end{thm}

\subsection{Edge connectivity}
%\begin{defi}
%A disconnecting set of edges is a set $F \subseteq E(G)$ such that $G\setminus F$ has more than one component. Given $S$, $T \subset V (G)$, the notation $[S, T]$ specifies the set of edges having one endpoint
%in $S$ and the other in $T$. An edge cut is an edge set of the form $[S, S]$, where $S$ is a non-empty proper subset of $V (G)$. A gr. is $k$-edge-conn. if every disconnecting set has at least $k$ edges.
%The edge-connectivity of $G$, written $\kappa'(G)$, is the minimum size of a disconnecting set. One edge disconnecting G is called a bridge.
%
%$G = Kn: \kappa'(G) = n - 1.$
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
\begin{rem}
An edge cut is a disconnecting set but not the other way around. However, every minimal disconnecting set is a cut.
\end{rem}

\begin{thm}
$\kappa (G) \le \kappa'(G) \le \delta(G).$
\end{thm}

\subsection{Blocks}
%\begin{defi}
%A block of a $G$ is a maximal conn. subgr. of $G$ that has no cut-vx.
%If $G$ itself is conn. and has no cut-vx, then $G$ is a block.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
\begin{rem}
If a block $B$ has at least three vxs, then $B$ is 2-conn. If an edge is a block of $G$ then it is a cut-edge of $G$.
\end{rem}

\begin{pro}
Two blocks in a gr. share at most one vx.
\end{pro}

%\begin{defi}
%The block gr. of a $G$ is a bipartite gr. $H$ in which one partite set consists of the cut-vxs of $G$, and the other has a vx $b_i$ for each block $B_i$ of $G$. We include $(v, b_i)$ as an edge of $H$ iff $v \in B_i.$
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
\begin{pro}
The block gr. of a conn. gr. is a tree.
\end{pro}

\subsection{2-conn. graphs}

%\begin{defi}
%Two paths are internally disjoint if neither contains a non-endpoint vx of the other. We denote the length of the shortest path from $u$ to $v$ (the distance from $u$ to $v$) by $d(u, v)$.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}
\begin{thm}[Whitney 1932]
A $G$ having at least three vxs is 2-conn. if and only
if each pair $u, v \in V (G)$ is conn. by a pair of internally disjoint $u, v$-paths in $G$.
\end{thm}

\begin{cor}
$G$ is 2-conn. and $|G|\ge 3$ iff every two vxs in $G$ lie on a common cycle.
\end{cor}
\subsection{Menger‚Äôs Thm}

%\begin{defi}
%Let $A,B \subseteq V$ . An $A-B$ path is a path with one endpoint in $A$, the other endpoint in $B$, and all interior vxs outside of $A \cup B$. Any vx in $A - B$ is a trivial $A-B$ path.
%
%If $X \subseteq V$ (or $X \subseteq E$) is such that every $A-B$ path in $G$ contains a vx (or an edge) from $X$, we say that $X$ separates the sets $A$ and $B$ in $G$. This implies in particular that $A \cap B \subseteq X$.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{1}
\begin{thm}[Menger 1927]
Let $G = (V,E)$ be a gr. and let $S, T \subseteq V$ . Then the maximum
\# vx-disjoint $S-T$ paths is equal to the minimum size of an $S-T$ separating vx set.
\end{thm}

\begin{cor}
For $S \subseteq V$ and $v\in V \setminus S$, the minimum \# vxs distinct from $v$ separating $v$ from $S$ in $G$ is equal to the maximum \# paths forming an $v-S$ fan in $G$. (that is, the maximum \# $\{v\}-S$ paths which are disjoint except at $v$).
\end{cor}

%\begin{defi}
%The line gr. of $G$, written $L(G)$, is the gr. whose vxs are the edges of $G$, with $(e, f) \in E(L(G))$ when $e = (u, v)$ and $f = (v,w)$ in $G$ (i.e. when $e$ and $f$ share a vx).
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
\begin{cor}
Let u and v be two distinct vxs of G.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $(u, v) \notin E$, then the minimum \# vxs different from $u, v$ separating $u$ from $v$ in $G$ is equal to the maximum \# internally vx-disjoint $u-v$ paths in $G$.
\item The minimum \# edges separating $u$ from v in G is equal to the maximum \# edge-disjoint $u-v$ paths in $G$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{cor}

\begin{thm}
(Global Version of Menger‚Äôs Theorem)
\begin{enumerate}
\item A gr. is k-conn. iff it contains k internally vx-disjoint paths between any
two vxs.
\item A gr. is k-edge-conn. iff it contains k edge-disjoint paths between any two
vxs.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Eul. trails \& tours}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
%\begin{defi}
%A trail is a walk with no repeated edges.
%\end{defi}

%\begin{defi}
%An Eulerian trail in a (multi)gr. $G = (V,E)$ is a walk in $G$ passing through every edge exactly once. If this walk is closed (starts and ends at the same vx) it is called an Eulerian tour.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
\begin{thm}
A conn. (multi)gr. has an Eulerian tour iff each vx has even degree.
\end{thm}

\begin{lem}
Every maximal trail in an even gr. (i.e., a gr. where all the vxs have even degree) is a closed trail.
\end{lem} 

\begin{cor}
A conn. multi$G$ has an Eulerian trail iff it has either 0 or 2 vxs of odd degree.
\end{cor}

\subsection{Hamilton paths and cycles}
%\begin{defi}
%A Hamilton path/cycle in a $G$ is a path/cycle visiting every vx of $G$ exactly once. A $G$ is called Hamiltonian if it contains a Hamilton cycle.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
\begin{pro}
If $G$ is Hamiltonian then for any set $S \subseteq V$ the gr. $G\setminus S$ has at most $|S|$ conn. components.

\begin{cor}
If a conn. bipartite gr. $G = (V,E)$ with bipartition $V = A\cup B$ is Hamiltonian then $|A|=|B|$.

If $G$ is a simple gr. with $n \ge 3$ vxs and if $\delta(G) \ge n/2$, then $G$ is Hamiltonian.

\begin{thm}[Ore 1960]
If $G$ is a simple gr. with $n\ge 3$ vxs such that for every pair of
non-adjacent vxs $u, v$ of $G$ we have $d(u) + d(v)\ge |G|$, then $G $ is Hamiltonian.
\end{thm}
\section{Matchings}
%\begin{defi}
%A set of edges $M \subseteq E(G)$ in a $G$ is called a matching if $e \cap e' = \emptyset$ for any pair of edges $e, e' \in M$.
%
%A matching is perfect if $|M|=\frac{|V (G)|}{2}$ , i.e. it covers all vxs of $G$. We denote the size of the maximum matching in $G$, by $\nu(G)$.

A bipartite gr. $G = (V,E)$ with bipartition $V = A\cup B$ has a matching
covering $A$ iff $|N(S)|\ge|S|\forall S \subseteq A$
\end{thm}

\begin{cor}
 If in a bipartite gr. $G = (A\cup B,E)$ we have $|N(S)|\ge|S|-d$ for every set $S \subseteq A$ and some fixed $d\in\mathbb{N}$, then $G$ contains a matching of cardinality $|A|- d$.
\end{cor}

\begin{cor}
If a bipartite gr. $G = (A \cup B,E) $ is $k$-regular with $k \ge 1$, then $G$ has a perfect matching.

\subsection{Matchings in general graphs: Tutte‚Äôs Theorem}
Given a $G$, let $q(G)$ denote the \# its odd components, i.e. the ones of odd order. If G has a perfect matching then clearly
$q(G\setminus S) \le|S| \forall S \subseteq V (G)$
since every odd component of $G\setminus S$ will send an edge of the matching to $S$, and each such edge covers a different vx in $S$.

\section{Planar Graphs}
%\begin{defi}
%A polygonal path or polygonal curve in the plane is the union of many line segments such that each segment starts at the end of the previous one and no point appears in more than one segment except for common endpoints of consecutive segments. In a polygonal $u, v$-path, the beginning of the first segment is $u$ and the end of the last segment is $v$.
%
%A drawing of a $G$ is a function that maps each vx $v\in V (G)$ to a point $f(v)$ in the plane and each edge $uv$ to a polygonal $f(u), f(v)$-path in the plane. The images of vxs are distinct.
%A point in $f(e)\cup f(e')$ other than a common end is a crossing. A gr. is planar if it has a drawing without crossings. Such a drawing is a planar embedding of $G$. A plane gr. is a particular drawing of a planar gr. in the plane with no crossings.
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}

%\begin{rem}
%We get the same class of graphs if we only require images of edges to be continuous curves. This is because any continuous line can be arbitrarily accurately approximated by a polygonal curve.
%\end{rem}

%\begin{defi}
%An open set in the plane is a set $U \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ such that for every $p\in U$, all points within some small distance from $p$ belong to $U$. A region is an open set $U$ that contains a polygonal $u, v$-path for every pair $u, v \in U$ (that is, it is ‚Äúpath-conn.‚Äù). The faces of a plane gr. are the maximal regions of the plane that are disjoint from the drawing.

\begin{thm}[Jordan curve theorem]
A simple closed polygonal curve C consisting of finitely
many segments partitions the plane into exactly two faces, each having C as boundary.

This is not true in three dimensions. In $\mathbb{R}$ there is a surface called the M√∂bius band which has only one side.
\end{rem}

\begin{rem}
The faces of $G$ are pairwise disjoint (they are separated by the edges of G). Two points are in the same face iff there is a polygonal path between them which does not cross an edge of $G$. Also, note that a finite gr. has a single unbounded face (the area ‚Äúoutside‚Äù of the graph).
\end{rem}

\begin{pro}

$K_5$ and $K_{3,3}$ are not planar.
\end{cor}

\begin{rem}[Maximal planar graphs / triangulations]
The proof of Theorem 6.14 shows that
having 3n - 6 edges in a simple n-vx planar gr. requires 2e = 3f, meaning that every face is
a triangle. If G has some face that is not a triangle, then we can add an edge between non-adjacent
vxs on the boundary of this face to obtain a larger plane graph. Hence the simple plane graphs
with 3n - 6 edges, the triangulations, and the maximal plane graphs are all the same family.

\section{Graph colouring}
\subsection{Vertex colouring}

%\begin{defi}
%A $k$-colouring of $G$ is a labeling $f : V (G) \to \{1, \dots , k\}$. It is a proper $k$-colouring if $(x, y) \in E(G)$ implies $f(x) \ne f(y)$. A gr. $G $ is $k$-colourable if it has a proper $k$-colouring. The
%chromatic number $\chi(G)$ is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ is $k$-colourable. If $\chi(G) = k$, then $G$ is
%$k$-chromatic. If $\chi(G) = k$, but $\chi(H) < k$ for every proper subgr. $H$ of $G$, then $G$ is colour-critical or $k$-critical.
%
%$\chi(K_n) = n$
%\end{defi}
\addtocounter{thm}{2}
\begin{rem}
The vxs having a given colour in a proper colouring must form an independent set, so $\chi(G)$ is the minimum \# independent sets needed to cover $V (G).$ Hence $G$ is $k$-colourable iff $G$ is $k$-partite. Multiple edges do not affect chromatic number. Although we define
$k$-colouring using numbers from $\{1, \dots , k\}$ as labels, the numerical values are usually unimportant, and we may use any set of size $k$ as labels.

\begin{thm}[Cayley's formula]
There are $n^{n-2}$ labeled trees on $n$ vxs.
\end{thm}

Now consider an arbitrary conn. simple $G$ on vx set $[n]$, and denote the \# spanning trees by $t(G)$. The following celebrated result is Kirchhoff‚Äôs matrix tree theorem. To formulate it, consider the incidence matrix $B$ of $G$ (as in Def 1.13), and replace one of the
two 1‚Äôs by -1 in an arbitrary manner to obtain the matrix $C$ (we say $C$ is the incidence matrix of an orientation of $G$). $ M = CC^T$ is then a symmetric $n \times n$ matrix, which is 

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
d(1) & 0 & 0  \\
0 & \ddots & 0  \\

\begin{thm}[Matrix tree theorem]
We have $t(G) = det M_{ii}$ for all $i = 1, \dots , n$, where $M_{ii}$ results
from $M$ by deleting the $i$-th row and the $i$-th column.

\subsection{P√≥sa‚Äôs Lemma}
Let $P$ be a path in a $G$, say from $u$ to $v$. Given a vx $x \in P$, we write $x^-$ for the vx preceding $x$ on $P$, and $x^+$ for the vx following $x$ on $P$ (whenever these exist). Similarly, for $X \subseteq V (P)$ we put $X^\pm:=\{x^\pm:x\in X\}$

If $x \in P\setminus u$ is a neighbour of $u$ in $G$, then $P \cup \{(u, x)\}\setminus\{(x, x^-)\}$ (which is a path in $G$ with vx
set $V (P)$) is said to have been obtained from $P$ by a rotation fixing $v$. A path obtained from $P$ by a (possibly empty) sequence of rotations fixing $v$ is a path derived from $P$. The set of starting vxs of paths derived from $P$, including $u$, will be denoted by $S(P)$. As all paths derived from $P$ have the same vx set as $P$, we have $S(P) \subseteq V (P)$.

\begin{rem}
If some sequence of rotations can delete the edge $(x, x^-)$, call this edge a broken edge. Note that every interval of the original path not containing broken edges is traversed by all derived paths as a whole piece (however, the direction can change).

\section{Ramsey Theory}

\begin{pro}
Among six people it is possible to find three mutual acquaintances or three mutual non-acquaintances.
\end{pro}

As we shall see, given a natural number $s$, there is an integer $R$ such that if $n \ge R$ then every colouring of the edges of $K_n$ with red and blue contains either a red $K_s$ or a blue $K_s$. More generally, we define the Ramsey number $R(s, t)$ as the smallest value of $N$ for which every red-blue colouring of $K_N$ yields a red $K_s$ or a blue $K_t$. In particular, $R(s, t) = \infty$ if there is no such $N$ such that in every red-blue
colouring of $K_N$ there is a red $K_s$ or a blue $K_t$. It is obvious that
$ R(s, t) = R(t, s)$ for every $s, t \ge 2$ and $R(s, 2) = R(2, s) = s$. 

\begin{thm}[Erd√∂s, Szekeres]
The function $R(s, t)$ is finite for all $s, t \ge 2$. Quantitatively, if $s > 2 $ and $t > 2$ then $R(s, t)\le R(s - 1, t) + R(s, t - 1)$ and $R(s, t) \le \binom{s+t-2}{s-1}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
Given $k$ and $s_1, s_2, \dots , s_k$, if $N$ is sufficiently large, then every colouring of $K_N$ with $k$ colours is such that for some $i, 1 \le i \le k$, there is a $K_{s_i}$ coloured with the $i$-th colour. The
minimal value of $N$ for which this holds is usually denoted by $R_k(s_1, \dots , s_k)$ , and it satisfies $R_k(s_1, \dots , s_k)\le R_{k-1}(R(s_1, s_2), s_3, \dots , s_k)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
Let $min\{s, t\} > 3$. Then
$R^{(3)}(s, t) \le R(R^{(3)}(s - 1, t),R^{(3)}(s, t - 1)) + 1$
\end{thm}

that every set of at least $N(m)$ points in the plane, with no three collinear, contains an $m$-subset forming a convex $m$-gon.
\end{thm}
